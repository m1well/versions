# versions

This is a script to display the version numbers of your tools.<br>
It is probably never complete... ;)<br>


## Problem
I want to see the version numbers of all my used tools with one command.<br>


## Solution
<pre>
This script. ;)<br>
Actually following tools are listed (alphabetically):<br>
* OS (Linux / Windows / macOS)
* Angular CLI
* Atom
* Bash
* CloudFoundry CLI
* Docker
* Git
* Gradle
* Gulp
* Homebrew
* Java
* Make
* Maven
* Npm
* Node
* Spring CLI
* ZSH
</pre>
Screenshot macOS:<br>
![screenshot-macos](screen-macos.png "Screenshot macOS")
<br>
<br>
Screenshot Windows:<br>
![screenshot-windows](screen-windows.png "Screenshot Windows")


## Usage
#### versions.sh
If you don't have any listed tool, then the script doesn't print it out.<br>

## Environment Info
##### unix
I am not so familiar with all different unix shells, but i think u can use it with all standard shells<br>
##### windows
For windows i take the gitBash shell to use the script<br>
